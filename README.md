# AI-First CRM - HCP Interaction Module

This project is an AI-first CRM module for logging Healthcare Professional (HCP) interactions through a conversational assistant.

The application has a React frontend with a live interaction details panel and a FastAPI backend powered by LangGraph and Groq. The assistant extracts structured CRM fields from natural language, asks clarification questions when information is missing, updates the draft in real time, and executes workflow tools once the interaction is ready.

## Features

- Conversational HCP interaction logging
- Live interaction draft updates in the frontend
- Multi-turn clarification flow for missing required fields
- Safe multi-interaction handling
- Editing of the active logged interaction
- Follow-up date and action generation
- Interaction summarization
- Compliance checking for completed interactions
- Backend test coverage for graph, tools, services, APIs, and workflows

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Vite, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit
- Backend: FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy async, Alembic
- Agent workflow: LangGraph
- LLM provider: Groq
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Testing: Pytest, Vitest

## LangGraph Tools

The backend registers five LangGraph tools:

- `log_interaction`: creates a new HCP interaction record
- `edit_interaction`: updates the active interaction record
- `generate_followup`: generates follow-up actions from interaction context
- `summarize_interaction`: creates a concise interaction summary
- `compliance_check`: checks interaction content for compliance issues

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL
- Groq API key

## Environment Setup

Create a backend environment file:

```powershell
cd backend
copy .env.example .env
```

Update `backend/.env` with your local values:

```env
DATABASE_URL="your database URL"
GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
DEFAULT_MODEL="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
```

Make sure the PostgreSQL database exists before starting the backend.

## Run The Backend

From the project root:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r backend\requirements.txt
cd backend
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

If you already activated the virtual environment:

```powershell
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The backend runs at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Run The Frontend

Open a second terminal:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173
```

Open the app in the browser:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

If PowerShell blocks `npm`, use:

```powershell
npm.cmd run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173
```

## Verification

Run backend tests:

```powershell
cd backend
$env:PYTHONPATH="E:\AI HCP\backend"
pytest
```

Run frontend tests:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd test -- --run
```

Build the frontend:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd run build
```

Current verification status:

- Backend: 71 tests passing
- Frontend: 8 tests passing
- Frontend production build passing

## Suggested Demo Flow

1. Start the backend and frontend.
2. Open the frontend at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
3. Ask the assistant to log an interaction, for example:

```text
Log an interaction with Dr. Verma.
```

4. Answer clarification questions naturally:

```text
Today at 1 PM.
It was a phone call.
We discussed reports and suggested medications. It is completed.
```

5. Show the left-side interaction draft updating live.
6. Let `log_interaction` execute and show the CRM success state.
7. Edit the active interaction:

```text
Add a follow-up in 15 days.
```

8. Demonstrate the remaining tools:

```text
Generate a follow-up for this interaction.
Summarize this interaction.
Run a compliance check.
```

9. To start a second interaction, use explicit wording:

```text
Log another interaction with Dr. Sharma.
```

The app intentionally keeps the current interaction active unless the user clearly asks to log another/new interaction or answers yes when prompted.

## Notes

- Required fields for logging an interaction include HCP information, date, interaction type, status, and discussion summary.
- The assistant asks clarification questions instead of creating incomplete records.
- After an interaction is logged, edits and follow-ups stay attached to the active interaction unless the user explicitly starts a new one.
